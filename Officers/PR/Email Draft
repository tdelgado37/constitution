Hello (Company Rep) ,

My name is (Your Name), I am the Public Relations Officer for the Open Source Club. We talked at the (Where you met the person, note this could just be omitted if you already have a relationship). I was wondering if (Company) would be interested in doing a talk this academic year about Free Open Source Software or about a technical skill that current members could use in order to contribute to Open Source. For example, we had Captial One come in for a talk about AngularJS. If your company does want to provide a talk, we do ask that they sponsor pizza for that club meeting ,which would for 20 - 30 students. Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns. 

Look forward to hearing from you soon.
